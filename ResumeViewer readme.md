ResumeViewer
=========

### Installation Instructions

ResumeViewer uses Python with django 1.6 and tastypie for an api. To install using virtualenv:

(assuming python 2.7.x, [pip], and  [virtualenv] has been installed)
```sh
$virtualenv env
$source ./env/bin/activate
$pip install django==1.6
$pip install django-tastypie
$python manage.py runserver
```
The default server now launches at localhost:8000. Point a browser to that address and you'll be at the login/registration screen.

If you're using the provided sample database, you should be able to log in with the following credentials:
- username: abc
- password: 123
Otherwise feel free to create your own user and log in.

**Using the app**

Should be fairly straightforward :) Click on 'add job' to add a new job, and 'save' to save your list of jobs.


### Design notes
I used django forms for the sign in, and django's default built in user management and authentication system. Once signed in, A 'static' page with angularjs is loaded. JS in the front end communicates with the database with the api generated by tastypie (see api.py). It POSTS everytime a new job is created, and PUTs when you hit save.
